> We've pre-populated this Challenge Project Overview page — which is what will be shared with your Break Through Tech student team in August — using the details from your submission form. You should have received an email inviting you to join this repo as a Collaborator, which will allow you to add files and make edits.
> 
> In order for your project to be finalized and assigned to a team, please:
> 1. **Review all sections below** and update or expand any content as needed, making sure to address the SME Feedback in the section immediately below. Look for square brackets to find the places below that require additional inputs from you (e.g., "About [Company / Org Name]").
> 2. **Add your dataset** to the [data folder](data) in this repo.
> 3. **Close the Issue assigned to you in this repo** to let us know that you have made your edits and the overview page is ready for final review. You can do this by going to the _Issues_ tab in the top left section of the menu above, add a comment that says "CA review complete", and click the button to Close the Issue.

## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff only — remove before sharing with students)*

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | The project focuses on using Python for NLP tasks, ensuring compatibility with students' skill sets in ML Foundations. |
| Data Readiness | 🟢 | The dataset is accessible and already structured in Excel format, making it ready for use with minimal cleaning required. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | Free-tier tools like Google Colab are adequate for the project's needs and pose no barriers for students. |

**Student Fit Score:** 8/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 7/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project leverages real-world data, providing a valuable learning opportunity. However, ensure students are equipped with the necessary NLP knowledge early on. Additionally, consider simplifying the model's expectations for iterative development to allow space for learning. Encourage students to document the challenges they face in model development for reflective learning. Overall, this project appears to be a suitable fit for the fellows with some adjustments.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use hospital emergency patient injury descriptions from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (CPSC NEISS), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to extract the objects involved in injury incidents. This will help our company address the business problem of workplace and product-related injury prevention, reducing injury-related costs, and improving safety and loss prevention strategies.

### Success Criteria
We will provide the students with a final testing set of anonymized workers' compensation accident descriptions. Their model should be able to correctly extract and classify the objects mentioned in the descriptions.

We will also compare it to our existing object detection model to see if the students' model performs favorably.

### Stretch Goal
If the students progress quickly enough, they can explore other fields mentioned in the NEISS (specifically NEISS Work) database.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | [Title] | students have downloaded and explored the data, and they have a final plan for their model's logic |
| October | [Title] | students have produced a v1 for their model and they have some initial model validation results |
| November | [Title] | students have made improvements on their model. the final version can correctly extract and classify objects mentioned in workers' accident descriptions. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
